# Power Automate Samples

Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
This is the repository to share some of the Power Automate cloud flows that I create for my Youtube videos, blog posts, studying or when trying new scenarios.

Here is the list of samples:

- [**Update Power Platform Users photo with Microsoft 365 photo**:](samples/Update%20Power%20Platform%20Users%20photo%20with%20M365%20photo/README.md) This sample demonstrates how you can synchronize the user photos on the Dataverse table called Users with the photos stored in Microsoft 365.


Hope you find them helpfull and please let me know if you have any comments, suggestions or anything else ðŸ˜‰
